Gitmarks
========

A web bookmark manager built on git and designed for github. It's searchable and social!

Gitmarks is a script that, given a URL, description, and tags, will download the content of the web page and store it along with the metadata so that you can easily search it (with grep!) and comment on it (with github!)

It's great for groups to collaboratively collect bookmarks in one spot (thanks to git itself!)

=======
Details
=======

For each URL, gitmarks will pull the content and store it under the 'content' directory. It stores the metadata under each tag in the 'tags' directory.

You can use git as usual to see who committed what and when, or you can grep your way to bookmark happiness on the command line.

=====
Usage
=====

python gitmark.py [url]

options:
	-p = do not push to origin (store bookmark locally only)
	-m = description of the bookmark
	-t = a comma-delimited list of tags
	
Example:

python gitmark.py -m 'my site' -t me,hilary_mason,code,bookmarks http://www.hilarymason.com
